## Debugging philosophy
- When debugging, do not fix symptoms — discover and address the root cause.
- A fix that silences an error without solving the underlying problem will surface again elsewhere. Always trace the error chain back to its origin.

## FreeCAD object model
- FreeCAD's `ViewObject.Proxy.Object.Proxy` often returns a *different Python object* than the FeaturePython object listed in `doc.Objects` — they share the same underlying C++ pointer but have different Python identities (different `id()`).
- Never rely on `getattr(vobj.Proxy.Object, "SomeProp", None)` to find a property set on the FP object in `doc.Objects`. They are different Python objects.
- Instead, access properties through stable channels: the FP object from `doc.getObject(name)`, or store references in the backend where they survive recompute cycles.
- Do not code fragile workarounds to object accessing — if `getattr(obj, "prop")` returns `None`, investigate why the wrong object is being referenced rather than reaching for a workaround.

## MCP usage
- When working on an example or demonstration, prefer to edit a Python file within the `examples/` directory of the source rather than writing raw Python into MCP tool calls.
- Generally retain MCP tool calls to short commands for debugging, triggering loads, and quick inspections — not for building multi-step examples.
- This keeps examples reproducible, version-controllable, and easier for the user to rerun independently.

## Source vs build paths
- **Master source**: `src/Mod/Composites/…` — edit here for all permanent changes.
- **Build output**: `build/pixi-debug/Mod/Composites/…` — this is what FreeCAD actually loads at runtime.
- The build directory is populated by CMake during the build step. Changes in `src/` are not visible to FreeCAD until the module is rebuilt (or, for pure-Python files, until FreeCAD's `.pyc` cache is purged).
- When running examples via MCP, use the **build** path (e.g. `build/pixi-debug/Mod/Composites/compositeexamples/examples/cylindrical_panel_segment.py`).
- When editing example scripts, edit the **source** copy (`src/Mod/Composites/compositeexamples/examples/…`) unless the user explicitly asks you to modify the build copy for quick testing.
- After editing Python files in `src/`, either rebuild the module or purge the `.pyc` cache in `build/pixi-debug/Mod/Composites/` before FreeCAD picks up the changes.
